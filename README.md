Team: Jeff Brown, Emily Frels, Jeanine Vincent

## Project Description
Golf Information Kiosk

    The ultimate golf road trip
    
    The beating heart of America lies in its great middle and the pulsing artery 
    of the nation is the Mississippi River
    
    It stretches from its headwaters in icy Lake Itasca in Northwestern Minnesota 
    and flows more than 2,300 miles to the Golf of Mexico
    
    An opportunity to discover America through itâ€™s golf courses and experience 
    a wide range of American regional culture

## Instructions:

    Step 1: Extract, clean and transform the input dataset (golf_ETL.ipynb)

        Before running this Jupyter notebook, make sure that you update the 
        config.py file with a Google Map API Key as gkey

    Step 2: Load the golf details into a PostgreSQL database (golf_db_load.ipynb)

        Before running the load process, follow these steps:

            1. create a new database in ProstgreSQL and name it Golf

            2. run schema.sql to create the table in the new database

            3. use the config.py file to store username and password for 
               the new database you just created - it should look like this

                username = "postgres"
                password = "mypassword"

    Step 3: Use Flask as web server

        At the root directory of this project, run python app.py

    Step 4: Happy browsing the Mississippi River Golf Adventure information kiosk

        Use Google Chrome to open the localhost URL
        
        Follow the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Louisiana
        
        Plan your next Great River Road trip and explore the USA even more
